Fully implements state machine:
* Caching paths G7:M16
* Decision B2
* Resource exists with "If-Match: *" header H7
* PUT on existing resource -> P11
* Positive path for M7 & N5 -> N11, etc.
* Fix delete path around M20
* Conflict handling O14
* Multiple representations O18
* Responses with no entity O20
* Redirect N11
* New resource P11

Easy to test each method on a resource e.g. isWellFormed()
