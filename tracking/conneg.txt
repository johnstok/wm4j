# General algorithm

 1. If header is NULL make default selection.
 2. Parse header into 0 or more weighted ranges.
 3. Set the default quality for supported values.
 4. For each weighted range apply the quality to matching supported values.
 5. Select the supported value with the highest non-0 quality.
 6. Return NULL if no supported value has a quality > 0.

# QValue (3.9) <- this is our WeightedValue - rename?

   HTTP content negotiation (section 12) uses short "floating point"
   numbers to indicate the relative importance ("weight") of various
   negotiable parameters.  A weight is normalized to a real number in
   the range 0 through 1, where 0 is the minimum and 1 the maximum
   value. If a parameter has a quality value of 0, then content with
   this parameter is `not acceptable' for the client. HTTP/1.1
   applications MUST NOT generate more than three digits after the
   decimal point. User configuration of these values SHOULD also be
   limited in this fashion.

       qvalue         = ( "0" [ "." 0*3DIGIT ] )
                      | ( "1" [ "." 0*3("0") ] )

   "Quality values" is a misnomer, since these values merely represent
   relative degradation in desired quality.

# Accept-Charset

TEST: WeightedValue<Charset> default value is 1

TEST: "*" matches every character set (including ISO-8859-1) which is not
mentioned elsewhere.
 
TEST: If no "*" is present in an Accept-Charset field, then all character sets 
not explicitly mentioned get a quality value of 0, except for ISO-8859-1, which
gets a quality value of 1 if not explicitly mentioned
 
TEST: If no Accept-Charset header is present, the default is that any character 
set is acceptable.
 
# Accept-Language

WeightedValue<LanguageRange> default value is 1

TEST: language-range  = ( ( 1*8ALPHA *( "-" 1*8ALPHA ) ) | "*" )
    
TEST: A language-range matches a language-tag if it exactly equals the tag, or if it 
exactly equals a prefix of the tag such that the first tag character following 
the prefix is "-".

TEST: The special range "*", if present in the Accept-Language field, matches every 
tag not matched by any other range present in the Accept-Language field.

TEST: The language quality factor assigned to a language-tag by the Accept-Language 
field is the quality value of the longest language- range in the field that 
matches the language-tag.

TEST: If no language- range in the field matches the tag, the language quality factor 
assigned is 0.

TEST: If no Accept-Language header is present in the request, the server SHOULD assume 
that all languages are equally acceptable.

TEST: If an Accept-Language header is present, then all languages which are assigned a
quality factor greater than 0 are acceptable.
